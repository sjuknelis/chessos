# ChessOS
32-bit operating system that only runs chess

So far, a good amount of this code (mostly in the boot and cpu directories; none of the graphics or chess code) is forked from [cfenollosa's os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial). The plan is to rewrite all of this code over time and re-engineer it to better suit the specific needs of this project.

I also want to go beyond where that project left off by adding:
  * Mouse controls
  * Audio
  * Disk writing (save games/scores)
  * (potentially) Online play (P2P would be more interesting in my opinion)
